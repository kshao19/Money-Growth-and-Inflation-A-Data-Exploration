### Exploratory Data Analysis

This EDA seeks to show key economic concepts using real life data, such as:
- What is the relationship between real and nominal GDP
- What are the differences between different indicators for inflation: PPI (Producer Price Index), CPI (Consumer Price Index), PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures)
- Does printing money leads to larger inflation? ("Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon." (Milton Friedman, 1970))

### Data Sources
